Overview.
Creation pattern:
separate the construction of and object from its representation.
The builder pattern is a creational pattern whose intent is to separate the constucdion of a complex object from its representation so that you can use the same condstruction process to create different representations.

The builder pattern tries to solve.
* How can a class create different representations of a complex object?
* How can a class that includes creating a complex object be simplified?
