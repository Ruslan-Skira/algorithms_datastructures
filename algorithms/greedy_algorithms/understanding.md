Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms that make a series of choices,
each of which looks best at the moment. The idea is to choose the option
that seems to be the most beneficial at each step, with the hope that
these local optimum choices will lead to a global optimum solution.

Other explanation:
A greedy algorithm is one which makes locally optimal choices at any given point.
And once a choice is made, it is never reconsidered. This make the algorithm
shortsighted and it may not always find the optimal solution.

Advantages:
- Simplicity: Greedy algorithms are often easier to implement and understand
compared to other algorithms.
- Efficiency: They can be very efficient in terms of time complexity,
often running in linear or logarithmic time.
Disadvantages:
- Suboptimal Solutions: Greedy algorithms do not always produce
 the optimal solution for all problems.
- They can be shortsighted, making choices that seem best at the moment but
lead to worse outcomes later.
- Problem Specific: Greedy algorithms work well for specific types of problems
but may not be applicable to others.
