# Algorithm Training Package - Complete Interview Preparation

This repository contains comprehensive training materials for mastering two fundamental algorithm categories that frequently appear in technical interviews.

## 📦 Training Packages

### 1. 🔗 [Interval Algorithms Training](./INTERVAL_TRAINING_README.md)

**File**: `interval_training_tasks.py`

Master interval manipulation problems with 10 progressively challenging tasks:

- **Easy**: Basic merging, insertion
- **Medium**: Scheduling, intersection, optimization
- **Hard**: Employee scheduling, overlap detection, interval trees
- **Very Hard**: Calendar systems, skyline problems

**Key Libraries**: `bisect`, `heapq`, `collections`, `dataclasses`

### 2. 🛤️ [Dijkstra's Algorithm Training](./DIJKSTRA_TRAINING_README.md)

**File**: `dijkstra_training_tasks.py`

Master shortest path algorithms with 10 progressive implementations:

- **Easy**: Basic Dijkstra, path reconstruction
- **Medium**: Network delays, flight booking, minimum effort
- **Hard**: Water levels, binary matrices, MST
- **Very Hard**: Multi-constraints, advanced applications

**Key Libraries**: `heapq`, `collections`, `enum`, `bisect`

## 🎯 Learning Approach

### Progressive Difficulty

Both packages follow the same proven structure:

1. **Foundation Building** - Start with basic concepts
2. **Skill Development** - Add complexity gradually
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Learn common variations
4. **Expert Mastery** - Handle advanced scenarios

### Multiple Solution Approaches

Each problem includes 2+ different implementations:

- **Basic approaches** for understanding
- **Optimized solutions** for performance
- **Alternative techniques** for different trade-offs

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone or download the repository
cd /home/ruslan/Projects/algorithms_datastructures

# Run interval training
python interval_training_tasks.py

# Run Dijkstra training
python dijkstra_training_tasks.py
```
